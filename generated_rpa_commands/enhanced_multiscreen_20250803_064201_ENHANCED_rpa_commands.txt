Here's a comprehensive set of natural language RPA commands designed to replicate the entire 198.5-second workflow shown in the multimodal recording.  Because the video and audio analysis are missing, I'm relying solely on the provided timestamped keyboard events.  This means some commands might be less precise regarding mouse clicks and UI element selection than if visual data were available.  However, the commands aim for complete workflow coverage.

**Assumptions:**

* The application is a Murex MX.3 trading system.
* The user is already familiar with the application's layout and navigation.
*  The application has standard keyboard navigation (Tab for field selection, Enter/Return for confirmation).
*  There are no unexpected errors or dialogs requiring specific handling beyond standard confirmation prompts.

**RPA Commands:**

1. **Login:**
    * Open the Murex MX.3 application.
    * Type "MUREXO" into the "Username" field.
    * Type the password into the "Password" field (Password is not provided in the data).
    * Click the "LOGIN" button.

2. **Select Group:**
    * A "Welcome back, MUREXO!" window appears.
    * Select the "FD MA (GROUP)" option from the list of groups.
    * Click the "START" button.

3. **Navigate to Bonds:**
    * Wait for the application to load.
    * Click on the "Bonds" option in the navigation menu (or use equivalent keyboard shortcut if available).  This assumes the menu is accessible via a click or keyboard shortcut.

4. **Search and Select Bond:**
    * The Bonds screen loads.  The provided data doesn't specify the search criteria, so this step needs clarification from the video/audio.  A placeholder is provided.
    * Search for a specific bond (e.g., using a bond code or name).  The exact search criteria needs to be determined from the video/audio.
    * Select the desired bond from the search results.

5. **Open Bond Properties:**
    * Double-click the selected bond to open its properties window.  (Or use the equivalent keyboard shortcut or menu option).

6. **Populate Bond Properties:**
    * Type "SAGB123456" into the "Security" field.
    * Select "Group Bond" from the "Type" dropdown.
    * Select "Coupon" from the "Type" dropdown.
    * Select "Fixed" from the "Bond type" dropdown.
    * Select "Mortgage" from the "Industry" dropdown.
    * Type "1,000,000.00" into the "Reference bond capital" field.
    * Select "ZAR" from the "Reference bond currency" dropdown.
    * Select "20 Nov 2024" from the "First accrual date" date picker.  (This assumes a date picker is used).
    * Select "20 Nov 2040" from the "Maturity date" date picker. (This assumes a date picker is used).
    * Type "0.000000" into the "Coupon %" field.
    * Select "ZAR" from the "Coupon currency" dropdown.
    * Select "ACT/365" from the "Day count" dropdown.
    * Select "NSX ZAR" from the "Market" dropdown.

7. **Process Bond Data:**
    * Click the "Process" button.
    * A confirmation dialog might appear; click "OK" to confirm.

8. **Close Windows:**
    * Close the Bond Properties window.
    * Close the Bonds search window.

**Error Handling (Placeholder):**

* If any step fails (e.g., login fails, bond not found), implement appropriate retry logic with error messages logged.  The specific error handling needs to be determined from the video/audio.

**Important Note:**  This RPA script is incomplete without the missing video and audio analysis.  The commands related to mouse clicks, dropdown selections, and search criteria are placeholders and need to be replaced with precise actions based on the visual and audio data.  The password also needs to be added.  Once that information is provided, the script can be made much more accurate and robust.
