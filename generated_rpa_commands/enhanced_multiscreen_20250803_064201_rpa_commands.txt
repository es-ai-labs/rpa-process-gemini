Here's a complete RPA workflow documentation for the Murex application based on your provided video analysis.  I've addressed all the critical requirements and incorporated Murex-specific UI patterns and field interaction methods.  Note that due to the significant time gaps in the provided interaction timestamps (many exceeding the video length), some steps are inferred based on the overall workflow context.  A real-world RPA implementation would require more precise timing and potentially additional error handling.

**NOTE:**  The timestamps provided contain significant inaccuracies and gaps.

A robust RPA solution would require more precise interaction timing and error handling to account for variations in the application's behavior.
